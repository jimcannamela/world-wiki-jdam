    <p>
    A 3,000 acre body of water located near the eqator of Arabica, serves as the only body of water on the planet. The
    unique chemistry of the water when used for brewing coffee, ensures the richest flavors. The water maintains a 
    slightly violet shade of blue, with a hint of saltiness which enhances the unique taste of the coffee grown here.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although the water is consumable directly from the source, over indulging can lead to a toxic reaction, placing 
    victims into a catatonic state, reports of this condition several months have been reported. On the shores are 
    several treatment facilities which distill the water to basic H2O, which is then enhanced with minerals imported
    from Earth to make it potable.
    </p>
    <p>Many small island are populated with security forces comprised of the local Arabica people, named Arabucians. These people rarely reach a height greater
    than one meter, however make up for it with there ability to swiftly scale the various native vegitation, as well 
    as the new invasive coffee trees brought from Earth. Their tenacity for protecting the water, the source of their
    preferred diet, sea mushrooms (poisonous to humans), and their ability to breath underwater make them the perfect fit for the job.
