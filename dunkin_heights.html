    <h2>Welcome to Dunkin Heights ("The DH")</h2>
    <p>Dunkin Heights is the fastest growing location on the world of Arabica.</p>
    <p>This island paradise is known for its beautiful weather and laid back island culture.</p>
    <p>While English was adopted as the primary language of the island, the DH is home to dozens</p>
    <p>of other languages from all over Earth, each of them adding to the cultural diversity</p>
    <p>of the island.</p>

    <p>Crime was once a problem when the island city was first founded, however since the creation</p>
    <p>of an artifical intelligence overlord named "<em>Skippy</em>," and the addition of android police force,</p>
    <p>crime has all but been eliminated. However, while the crime-rate is low in, the DH, the island</p>
    <p>has recently shown interest in the conquest of other cities on Arabica and has recently started mobilizing</p>
    <p>for war.</p>
    <p>The DH, while a beautiful location, is also home to a number of dangerous types of plant and animal life.</p>
    <p>Visitors are cautioned against leaving populated areas unarmed or without an armed escort.</p>
